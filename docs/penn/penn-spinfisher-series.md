# Penn Spinfisher Series

The Penn Spinfisher series of open-faced spinning reels ranged from the ultralight [720/722 models](penn-720-service-guide.md)--mostly intended for freshwater fishing--to the largest, the mighty 704/705 models, designed for heavy saltwater duty. Accordingly, the line capacities for the spools, materials, and overall heft of the reels in the 700 series varied. These reels were very simple, strong, dependable designs, and many are still in use today. Since there are currently (2026) a fair number of these reels available in the used marketplace, spare parts are reasonably available too--it's a good idea to buy a "parts" reel that matches the reel that actually goes out into the field. In the case of the 720/722, there are even a few parts (like the drag cap) available new.

Penn made each size Spinfisher in two different models, with the most important differences being the same across the entire series--one model in each size used a brass bushing on the main shaft, and the other model used a ball bearing, with the practical result being smoother cranking action for the slightly upgraded, ball bearing version. The model numbers for these pairs of reels were 720/722, 710/711, 712/713, and 704/705.

For example, the Penn 722 was basically the same reel as the 720 with a few minor upgrades, the most important mechanical difference being that the 722 uses a ball bearing on the main shaft --the 720 uses a brass bushing. The practical implication is that the 722 has a bit smoother cranking action. In terms of appearance, the 722 was finished in light green (known to enthusiasts as a "greenie")-- the 720 was finished in a light metallic blue.

Otherwise the reels are mechanically almost identical, and the practical implication of this is that most parts are interchangeable. If you need a replacement part for a 720, then you could locate and use either a 720 or a 722 for most internal parts. You could even mix and match exterior parts like the housing, housing plate, and rotor cup. The same is true for the other model pairs, for instance, most parts can be interchanged between the 704 and 705 models.

## The Spinfishers and Balanced Tackle

The concept of balanced tackle provides a logical and practical method for determining which reel, rod, and line combinations work best with a given range of lure weights--and lure weights are determined by the species of fish being sought, and field conditions. The Penn Spinfisher series included reels that would work with light action 5 1/2'
rods, 2 lb. test line and lure weights down to 1/8 oz. (the 720/722 ultralights) up to medium action 10' rods, 30 lb. test line, and 4 1/2 oz. lures--covering a very large range of fish species and field conditions. The following table is taken from the Penn Fishing Tackle Mfg. Co. Penn Reels Instruction Manual, included with the Spinfishers, and summarizes the entire range of balanced tackle combinations possible with the Spinfishers.

For a more complete discussion of balanced tackle, see Henry Shakespeare's 1962 "Secrets of Successful Fishing." This small volume (fits in a tackle box) provides a real wealth of basic knowledge about all aspects of all fishing types (spinning, spincasting, bait casting, and fly fishing), and is still (in 2026) remarkably current, particularly when working with vintage tackle. Used copies are easily and inexpensively available on used book sites like Abe Books; highly recommended.
