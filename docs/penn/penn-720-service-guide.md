# Penn 720 Service Guide

The Penn 720 is an open-faced spinning reel, part of Penn's 700 "spinfisher" series, which ranged from the smallest--the 720, mostly intended for freshwater fishing--to the largest, the mighty 706, designed for heavy saltwater duty. Accordingly, the line capacities for the spools, materials, and overall heft of the reels varied. These reels were very simple, strong, dependable designs, and many are still in use today. This guide will show you how to disassemble, clean, lubricate, and reassemble the Penn 720 Spinfisher.

The badge varies depending on the year. The example reel here has the earlier badge design. [show example of later design, etc.]

The 720 was a very simple design with a few interesting exterior features.

![Penn 720--Anti-Reverse(../../img/penn/720/penn-720-anti-rev-800x600px.jpg)

The Eccentric Lever (part #6E) has two positions; in one the anti-reverse and clicker are engaged, in the other the retrieve is silent.

The handle can be rotated for storage by loosening the nut at the base then re-tightening.

Specs: Weight with line on the spool: 10.5 oz/~.3 kg.

This video [YT vid, to be recorded] provides a very general overview of the Penn 720 and this procedure. Use the following sections for detailed instructions.

Place in a Balanced Tackle Setup: What rods, lines, casting weights, fishing types--salt/fresh, species, trolling, surf fishing, etc.

History, Models, Years, and Variations: Different badges, rough estimate of year, typical manufacturer's marks.

Typical Issues: For example, clicker/anti-reverse not working.

Difficulty and Time for this Procedure: The Penn 720 is probably one of the simplest open-face spinning reels to service, so it is a good choice for a first project--but don't let this make it seem insignificant--it does require some dexterity and patience, and acquiring a "feel" for working on vintage reels, and at the same time it helps you build those very skills. If you already have your workspace set up and your tools and materials on hand, the evaluation and servicing might take around 3 hours, assuming you are a beginner and are proceeding at a leisurely pace (a good idea when first starting; don't be in a hurry). More experience will result in a considerably shorter timeframe.

## Preparation: Basic Workspace Setup and Safety
There are many possible configurations for setting up a workspace, but in general a few basic requirements should be considered. Since this is basically the same for all reels, see [Basic Workspace Setup and Safety](../workspace-setup-safety.md) before proceeding.

## Initial Evaluation
All vintage reels should be evaluated and tested before starting any work on them to provide a baseline for later comparison. Since this is basically the same for all reels, see [Initial Evaluation](../initial-evaluation.md) before proceeding.

## Tools and Materials
The basic set of simple tools and materials is the same for all reels; see [Tools and Materials](../tools-materials.md) before proceeding.

## Disassembly

1. Remove the line from the spool.
Since this procedure will be more or less the same for every reel see [Removing Line from and Adding Line to a Spool](../removing-adding-line.md) before proceeding.

2. Remove the drag cap (part #52) by turning it counter-clockwise (all directions assume you are looking at the front of the reel, with the reel upright--foot up--as it would be mounted on a rod).

![Penn 720--Drag Cap Removed(../../img/penn/720/penn-720-drag-cap2-800x600px.jpg)

This is a good time to inspect the plastic for cracks. Note that this example reel's drag cap has several minor cracks, which were repaired with epoxy. [link to mod on epoxy repairs]
Variations: On this example 720 cap the plastic completely surrounds the brass inner cap; on some caps more of the brass inner cap is exposed. This is a part that is subject to wear, so it's helpful for the repair person that it may be available as new/remanufactured [term?].

3. Remove the spool (part #47) by pulling straight out.

![Penn 720--Spool Removed(../../img/penn/720/penn-720-spool-800x600px.jpg)

This is a good time to inspect the drag and click mechanism on the inside of the spool. If it is possible to obtain one or two extra spools, for example, by purchasing "parts" reels, those will prove useful for keeping several pound-tests of line handy for quick changes in the field.

4. Remove the handle (part #15) by turning it clockwise (with the handle side of the reel facing you)--opposite to the direction you turn it to reel in line.

5. Remove the Housing Plate.

Unscrew the one screw used to secure the housing. A short-handled screwdriver is useful for working on large screws like this one.

![Penn 720--Removing Housing Plate(../../img/penn/720/penn-720-housing-plate2-800x600px.jpg)

Pry the Housing Plate from the main Housing. On some reels the plate may be stuck in place. Do not attempt to pry these apart with a screwdriver, which is likely to slip and damage the finish. Use a thin blade and work it carefully under into the gap between the two parts; eventually it should pop off.

You can now see the Main gear and associated parts. This is a good time to inspect the overall condition of the gears, the accumulation of old lubricants, etc.
