# Penn 730 Service Guide

The Penn 730 is an open-faced spinning reel, part of Penn's 700 "spinfisher" series, which ranged from the smallest--the 730, mostly intended for freshwater fishing--to the largest, the mighty 706, designed for heavy saltwater duty. Accordingly, the line capacities for the spools, materials, and overall heft of the reels varied. These reels were very simple, strong, dependable designs, and many are still in use today. This guide will show you how to clean, service, disassemble, and reassemble the 730.
