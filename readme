This site's main purpose is to provide detailed, illustrated service procedures for mid‑priced American‑made fishing reels from the 1930s–1970s. It also provides repair procedures and background information on the various reels. This is a growing and evolving repository for service and repair guides and historical background for spinning, spincasting ("push-button"), baitcasting, and fly-fishing reels.

This repository honors American craftsmanship of the early 20th century and provides resources for those interested in restoring and keeping concrete examples of that craftsmanship in working order, with the intent to use them in the field rather than simply collect, curate, and display them, although these activities are also valued. Line capacities and other specifications are provided to place these reels in the context of creating practical, affordable, balanced tackle for all types of fishing, in combination with modern tackle.
