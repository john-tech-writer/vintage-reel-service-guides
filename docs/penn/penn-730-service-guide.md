# Penn 730 Service Guide

The Penn 730 is an open-faced spinning reel, part of Penn's 700 "spinfisher" series, which ranged from the smallest--the 730, mostly intended for freshwater fishing--to the largest, the mighty 706, designed for heavy saltwater duty. Accordingly, the line capacities for the spools, materials, and overall heft of the reels varied. These reels were very simple, strong, dependable designs, and many are still in use today. This guide will show you how to disassemble, clean, lubricate, and reassemble the Penn 730 Spinfisher.

Specs: Weight (with and/or without line on the spool), dimensions, materials (with variations like different arbor materials--cork, etc., gears brass or steel, or nylon), line capacity for various lb. tests, gear ratios.

This video provides a very general overview of the Penn 730 and this procedure. Use the following sections for detailed instructions.

Place in a Balanced Tackle Setup: What rods, lines, casting weights, fishing types--salt/fresh, species, trolling, surf fishing, etc.

History, Models, Years, and Variations: Different badges, rough estimate of year, typical manufacturer's marks.

Typical Issues: For example, clicker/anti-reverse not working.

Difficulty and Time for this Procedure: The Penn 730 is probably one of the simplest open-face spinning reels to service, so it is a good choice for a first project--but don't let this make it seem insignificant--it does require some dexterity and patience, and acquiring a "feel" for working on vintage reels, and at the same time it helps you build those very skills. If you already have your workspace set up and your tools and materials on hand, the evaluation and servicing might take around 3 hours, assuming you are a beginner and are proceeding at a leisurely pace (a good idea when first starting; don't be in a hurry). More experience will result in a considerably shorter timeframe.

## Preparation: Basic Workspace Setup and Safety
There are many possible configurations for setting up a workspace, but in general a few basic requirements should be considered. Since this is basically the same for all reels, see [Basic Workspace Setup and Safety](../workspace-setup-safety.md) before proceeding.

## Initial Evaluation
All vintage reels should be evaluated and tested before starting any work on them to provide a baseline for later comparison. Since this is basically the same for all reels, see [Initial Evaluation](initial-evaluation.md) before proceeding.

## Tools and Materials
The basic set of simple tools and materials is the same for all reels; see [Tools and Materials](tools-materials.md) before proceeding.

## Disassembly

1. Remove the line from the spool.
Since this procedure will be more or less the same for every reel see [Removing Line from and Adding Line to a Spool](removing-adding-line.md) before proceeding.

2. Remove the spool.
