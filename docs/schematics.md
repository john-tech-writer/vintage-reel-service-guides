# Schematics and Other Technical Documentation

Schematics are available in the Penn Reels Instruction Manual. These exploded diagrams and parts lists provide useful references when disassembling and reassembling the reel. This technical document and many others are available from the Old Reel Collectors Association library of downloadable reel schematics at the [ORCA website](https://www.orcaonline.org/product-category/orca-library/reel-schematics/). If you are a member these are free (a good value for the reel enthusiast). If you are not a member there is a charge for each document.

The ORCA website also provides links to other sources for technical documentation related to vintage reels.
