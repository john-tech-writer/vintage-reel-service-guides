# Spinning Reels

[Text about spinning reels, an overview, some content, arrangement, and topics will be taken at least in rough form from the Perplexity space on reel service guides.]

[Major American manufacturers of the period will be listed and briefly reviewed in historical/functional context, including Pflueger, Penn, etc.]

**Penn:** Brief overview of Penn's spinning reels and references to their other types of reels. [The Penn Spinfisher Series](/penn/penn-spinfisher-series.md) includes eight different models from ultralight to heavy duty.

**Pfleuger:** The Pelican.

**Ted Williams/Sears:** The 440. Like Craftsman tools of that era, very durable.
