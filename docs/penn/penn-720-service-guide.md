# Penn 720 Service Guide

## Overview

The Penn 720 is an ultralight open-faced spinning reel, part of Penn's 700 Spinfisher series, which ranged from the smallest--the 720, mostly intended for freshwater fishing--to the largest, the mighty 704, designed for heavy saltwater duty. Accordingly, the line capacities for the spools, materials, and overall heft of the reels in the 700 series varied.

This video [YT vid, to be recorded] provides a very general overview of the Penn 720.

These reels are very simple, strong, dependable designs, and many are still in use today. This guide shows you how to disassemble, clean, lubricate, and reassemble the Penn 720 Spinfisher. For more complete background on the very wide range of reels in the Spinfisher series, see [Penn's 700 Spinfisher series](penn-spinfisher-series.md).

**Similar Models:** The Penn 722 (not pictured) is basically the same reel with a few minor upgrades, the most important mechanical difference being that the 722 uses a ball bearing on the main shaft --the 720 uses a brass bushing. The practical implication is that the 722 has a bit smoother cranking action. In terms of appearance, the 722 is finished in light green (known to enthusiasts as a "greenie")-- the 720 is finished in a light metallic blue.  Otherwise the reels are mechanically almost identical, and the practical implication of this is that most parts are interchangeable. If you need a replacement part for a 720, then you could locate and use either a 720 or a 722 for most internal parts. You could even mix and match exterior parts like the housing, housing plate, and rotor cup. 

The small strips of painter's tape holding the line in place on the spool maintain tension on the spooled line when the reel is not in use. Painter's tape has many qualities that are useful for work on vintage reels--it sticks well to metal and plastic surfaces and yet is easily removed, and it does not leave sticky residue. It is also available in many widths for different applications.

**The Badge:** This varies depending on the year of production. The example reel here has the earlier badge design. This also shows the remarkable condition of the original light blue metallic finish, which (in 2026) is around 75 years old!

**Features and Controls:** The 720 is a very simple design with a few interesting exterior features.

The white plastic drag cap on the front of the spool is simply twisted to apply more drag or to back off the drag.

The eccentric lever has two positions; in one the anti-reverse and clicker are engaged, in the other the retrieve is silent. In this location, directly below the handle, it is easily engaged when a fish strikes to prevent the handle from revolving backwards.

The handle can be rotated for storage by loosening the nut at the base.

[Schematics](../schematics.md) are available in the Penn Reels Instruction Manual.

**Line Capacity**

lb. test | yds.
---------|-----
       4 | 300
       6 | 200
       8 | 150
      10 | 125

**Weight:** 9 1/2 oz.

**Gear ratio:** 4:1

**Rod length/action:** 5 1/2'--7' light action

**Lure weights:** 1/8--1/2 oz.

**Dimensions:**

**Materials:** The 720's housing and rotor cup are made of steel, as is the main gear; the rest of the gears are mostly brass. The crosswind block and drag cap are made of white plastic. The spool is made of aluminum.

**History, models, years, and variations:** There are two different badge designs for the 720--the example reel pictured here sports the older round emblem, and later reels changed to a more text-oriented design.

**Typical issues:** For example, clicker/anti-reverse not working.

**Difficulty and Time for This Procedure:** The Penn 720 is probably one of the simplest open-face spinning reels to service, so it is a good choice for a first project--but don't let this make it seem insignificant--it does require some dexterity and patience, and acquiring a "feel" for working on vintage reels, and at the same time it helps you build those very skills.

If you already have your workspace set up and your tools and materials on hand, the evaluation and servicing might take around 3 hours, assuming you are a beginner and are proceeding at a leisurely pace (a good idea when first starting; don't be in a hurry). More experience will result in a considerably shorter timeframe.

## Before You Begin

Complete an [initial evaluation](../initial-evaluation.md) of the reel. All vintage reels should be evaluated and tested before starting any work on them to provide a baseline for later comparison.

If you just acquired the reel, [remove the line from the spool](../removing-adding-line.md). There is no way to determine the age or condition of the line on a newly acquired vintage reel, so it makes sense to start with new line as the final part of servicing a reel. This also allows you to inspect the arbor to determine what type of material it is made of (this will help date the reel) and clean it along with the rest of the parts.

## Disassembly and Servicing

### Housing and Gears

1. Remove the drag cap by turning it clockwise.

    All directions assume you are looking at the front of the reel, with the reel upright--foot up--as it would be mounted on a rod.

    This is a good time to inspect the plastic for cracks. That this example reel's drag cap has several minor cracks, which were [repaired with epoxy](docs/epoxy-repairs.md).

    **Variations:** On this example 720 cap the plastic completely surrounds the brass inner cap; the design varied with different manufacture years, so that on some caps more of the brass inner cap is exposed--these all appear to be interchangeable. The drag cap is a part that is subject to wear. Some damage can be repaired; in other cases it may be necessary to locate a parts reel, and since these reels are relatively common it is also possible to find just the drag caps, used as well as newly manufactured. eBay is generally a good starting point for most parts.

2. Remove the spool by pulling straight out.

    ![Penn 720--Spool Removed](../../img/penn/720/penn-720-spool.jpg)

    This is a good time to inspect the drag and click mechanism on the inside of the spool. If it is possible to obtain one or two extra spools, for example, by purchasing parts reels, those will prove useful for keeping several pound-tests of line handy for quick changes in the field. Another option to consider with the 720 and the other Penn Spinfishers would be to obtain the sister model reel (in this case, the 722)--this would provide you with two spools which could be shared between the reels and the slightly different experience of the bearing-equipped reel versus the bushing- equipped 720.

3. Remove the handle by turning it clockwise (with the handle side of the reel facing you)--opposite to the direction you turn it to reel in line.

4. Remove the single screw that secures the housing plate.

    ![Penn 720--Removing Housing Plate](../../img/penn/720/penn-720-housing-plate2.jpg)

     A short-handled screwdriver is useful for working on large screws like this one.

5. Pry the housing plate from the main housing.

    ![Penn 720--Housing Plate Removed](../../img/penn/720/penn-720-housing-plate3.jpg)

    On some reels the plate may be stuck in place. Do not attempt to pry these apart with a screwdriver, which is likely to slip and damage the finish. Use your thumbnail or a thin blade and work it carefully under into the gap between the two parts; eventually it should pop off.

    You can now see the Main gear and associated parts. This is a good time to inspect the overall condition of the gears, the accumulation of old lubricants, etc.

    This example reel has already been disassembled, serviced, and reassembled, so the gears are very clean. The same reel before servicing shows accumulated old grease, which hardens and can impair function. It is not possible to know what sorts of lubricants have been applied over a particular reel's lifetime, so it is best to clean all the parts and start fresh with the correct [lubricants](../tools-materials.md).

6. Remove the spool shaft.

7. Remove the crosswind block.

8. Remove the pinion gear.
