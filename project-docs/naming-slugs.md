# Naming and slugs

Disciplined naming of directories and files keeps large projects more manageable. As this project goes through iteratations and refactors it's expected that the naming conventions and standards will evolve. This document is where it all gets documented.

## Slugs

Each reel gets a *slug* that is used consistently across folders and filenames.

As needed other items can be assigned slugs, for example, source documents about reels: `maker and reel docs/penn-700-series-manual.pdf`

Generally the slugs should be as specific as possible while keeping them as short as possible while still providing a clear idea of the file content.

### Pattern

  - Base:
`[maker]-[model]`
Example: `penn-720`

  - If there is a model number or size:
`[maker]-[model]-[model-number]`
Example: `pfleuger-pelican-1020`

  - If there is a variant:
`[maker]-[model]-[model-number](if applicable)-[variant]`
Example: `zebco-33-hudson-bay-red`

### Rules

  - In filenames slugs come first
  - All lowercase
  - For files that are or likely will be pushed to the repo, use hyphens between all words and codes, no spaces - for some documents, e.g., project development docs, spaces may be used
- In general do not use production years - *may* be used to distinguish variants

Workspace
  - Substack drafts: `.../substack/[slug]/[slug]-welcome-bench.md`
  - `maker and reel docs/maker/[slug]-manual.pdf`

Media folders
  - Pictures: `Pictures/vintage reel service guides/[maker]/[model]/[slug]-[desc].jpg`
  - Video: `Video/vintage reel service guides/[maker]/[model]/[overview / service guide / #]/[slug]-[desc].[mlt / mkv / rpp / wav / mp4 / txt]`
