This site is intended to provide a growing and evolving repository for service and repair guides plus historical background for mid-priced American-made reels for all types of fishing--spinning, spincasting, baitcasting, fly-fishing--from the 1930s through the 1970s; placing these reels in context of creating practical, usable, affordable balanced tackle for all types of fishing in combination with modern tackle. Part of the purpose of this repository is to celebrate American craftsmanship of the early 20th century, and to provide resources for those interested in keeping concrete examples of that craftsmanship in working order, with the intent to use them in the field rather than simply collect, curate, and display them, although these activities are also valued. Another aspect of this service/repair/usage approach is to suggest, explore, and discover how vintage reels can be integrated into modern tackle; for example, line will typically be new, and this repository will include information on appropriate pound-tests, line types, and spool capacities for each; this will facilitate making informed decisions about creating balanced tackle using a combination of the best of vintage and modern tackle. Spinning Reels Text about spinning reels, an overview, some content, arrangement, and topics will be taken at least in rough form from the Perplexity space on reel service guides. Major American manufacturers of the period will be listed and briefly reviewed in historical/functional context, including Pflueger, Penn, etc. Penn Brief overview of Penn's spinning reels, the 700 series in particular, and references to their other types of reels. Places all the 700 series reels in context of creating balanced tackle for different fishing applications--species, salt/fresh, trolling, surf fishing, etc. The Guides Each guide will provide step-by-step illustrated procedures for disassembling, servicing (cleaning and lubricating), and re-assembling the reel. The guides will also provide information on commonly required repairs [will this be documented within the service guide or linked to a separate procedure?] The Penn 730 .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#vintage-reel-service-guides","text":"This site documents service procedures for mid\u2011priced American\u2011made fishing reels from the 1930s\u20131970s.

Accordingly, the line capacities for the spools, materials, and overall heft of the reels varied. These reels were very simple, strong, dependable designs, and many are still in use today. This guide will show you how to disassemble, clean, lubricate, and reassemble the Penn 730 Spinfisher. This video provides a very general overview of the Penn 730 and this procedure. Use the following sections for detailed instructions. Place in a Balanced Tackle Setup: What rods, lines, casting weights, fishing types--salt/fresh, species, trolling, surf fishing, etc. Models, Years, and Variations: Different badges, rough estimate of year, typical manufacturer's marks. Typical Issues: Clicker/anti-reverse not working. Difficulty and Time for this Procedure: The Penn 730 is probably one of the simplest open-face spinning reels to service, so it is a good choice for a first project--but don't let this make it seem insignificant--it does require some dexterity and patience, and acquiring a \"feel\" for working on vintage reels, and at the same time it helps you build those very skills. If you already have your workspace set up and your tools and materials on hand, the evaluation and servicing might take around 3 hours, assuming you are a beginner and are proceeding at a leisurely pace (a good idea when first starting; don't be in a hurry). More experience will result in a considerably shorter timeframe. Preparation: Basic Workspace Setup and Safety There are many possible configurations for setting up a workspace, but in general a few basic requirements should be considered. Since this is basically the same for all reels, see Basic Workspace Setup and Safety before proceeding. Initial Evaluation All vintage reels should be evaluated and tested before starting any work on them to provide a baseline for later comparison. Since this is basically the same for all reels, see Initial Evaluation before proceeding. Tools and Materials The basic set of simple tools and materials is the same for all reels; see Tools and Materials before proceeding. Disassembly Remove the line from the spool. Since this procedure will be more or less the same for every reel see Removing Line from and Adding Line to a Spool before proceeding.
