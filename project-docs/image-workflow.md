# Photo workflow

## Camera settings

For Olympus PL1 camera body.

- Use 3 x 3 grid - press Info button to turn on / off.

- Shoot white card for white balance: Press start / OK, select capture WB icon, press info, point camera at white card, press shutter, select yes. If the camera can't set WB based on what's in front of it - low light, etc. - there will be error message WB NG RETRY.

- Manual setting

- ISO 200

- 2 sec timer

Using focus modes - for lenses with manual focus ring (e.g., the macro lens):

See p. 44 in PL-1 manual for full details

To set basic mode:

Menu > gears > AM / MF > AF mode > still picture / movie > S-AF+MF (auto-focus + allows fine manual adjustment) / MF (full manual control)

To turn MF assist on / off (if on, this zooms to 10x when using manual focus to assist with fine adjustments - but it can be distracting):

/ AM / MF > MF assist on / off

## Lenses

### m.zuiko digital ED 14-42mm 1:3.5-5.6 lens

Focal lengths, apertures, and shutter speeds will vary depending on the size of the reel or other object, lighting, etc. but here are some sample settings that seem to work for starting points. These settings were using the bench lighting (ceiling, over the bench, NEO, and sometimes a white card).

For the Pflueger Nobby:

Hero shots - angled, whole reel:
35mm - f11 - 1/10 sec

Side shots - straight on:
42mm - f5.6 - 1/60 sec

Service guide shots - e.g., disassembly:
15mm - f9 - 1/30, 1/20, 1/15 sec

Closer:
27mm / f9 / 1/25 sec

Need to doc working distance - ~13" I think.

For large-format book pages / manuals:
22mm - f11 - 1/10
28mm - f11 - 1/10

### m.zuiko digital ED 30 mm 1:3.5 macro lens

Fixed 30mm focal length.

Hero shots - angled, whole reel:
f11 - 1/10 sec

Side shots - straight on:
f5.6 - 1/50, 1/60,1/80 sec
f11 - 1/25 sec

Closer shots of details - e.g., logos:
f8 - 1/13 sec
f11 - 1/10 sec
f5.6 - 1/30 sec

Closer - gears and parts around 1 - 2cm
f11 - 1/2 sec
f5.6 - 1/8, 1/6 sec

For large-format book pages / manuals:
f11 - 1/10

Magnification is from 1/4 x - 1.25 x.

Need to doc better what size image field will be for a given distance.
- 1.5cm image field = ? working distance
- 2.2cm image field = ? working distance

Subject distance = .20 mm - .095 mm (.02 cm - ~ < 1 cm). Getting this close is challenging, depth of field drops off to almost zero, so focus is challenging, definitely manual adjustment is required. Tripod is best for getting this close - the smallrig arms are not good for fine adjustments.

exposure comp. = + 1/3 - +2 (not needed for auto mode)

Practical working distances: about 20 cm for full‑reel hero shots (≈0.25×), and roughly 6 cm for tight badge/part details (≈1–1.25×). So this is not true macro usage, but it works. The 14-42mm may work as well for most of this sort of thing.

Usable aperture range tested: f7.1 to f13 all producing solid images, with plans to compare f8 vs f11 more carefully at the hero distance.

Focusing workflow that finally felt comfortable: MF Assist off, using MF or S‑AF+MF as needed, with the focus ring behaving predictably on the PL1.

### Grids

In the Olympus PL1. To turn on and select type:

MENU > [two gears icon] > DISP/PC > /INFO SETTING > LV-Info > Displayed Grid [4 types or off]

During shooting use INFO to toggle selected grid on / off.

For details see in the workspace `photo-video-grids-framing.md`, also see PL-1 manual p. 44.

## Basic photos - initial session for new reels

Taken before the reel is serviced and also after. Used in overview, also possibly in service guide, on substack posts, etc.

See [Image lists](image-lists.md)

  - Multiple views of whole reel - front, handle-side, badge / drag-side, top, bottom, back, left (angled left), right (angled right)  - these will be candidates for hero images
  - Badge or nameplate
  - Exterior/special features (varies with reel, i.e., drag lever)

Details: Hero images should show what makes each reel *visually distinctive*, like the badge, finish, or proportions - while this can be more or less generalized for each reel type, e.g., for spinning reels the handle side is usually more interesting, and the bail should be rotated to show it off - it will be somewhat different for each reel, and this will contribute to the unique take on each reel.

### Framing / positioning

Heros:  Reel positioned as if mounted on rod, for example, for spinning reels the foot should be at top. Reel front facing left, center of front lower 3rd, handle side facing camera, handle at diagonal.

For detailed discussion and ideas, see in the workspace `photo-video-grids-framing.md`

### Disassembly and reassembly photos

Taken while working on reel in tray.
  - At least one image per user action/step. For some steps two or three images to show progression of more intricate moves.

  - Hands are always in frame.

  - Tools are always shown in use.

  - Maintain a clean workspace to reduce visual distractions. Only show tools actually in use on a specific reel.

  - Keep parts neatly organized in tray so all are clearly visible.

### Cleaning and lubrication photos

Cleaning and lubricating are covered in a generic document, but if there are any reel-specific cleaning/lubricating procedures for a specific reel, photograph those.

## File naming standards / slugs

Having consistent filenames for images will facilitate all current work and any future refactoring. The basic goal is to have descriptive but brief, self-explanatory filenames which will work in the repo, and which help provide a map through each procedure.

  - Basic example form is `[slug]-[description].jpg`

  - Always use hyphens (for compatability with repo).

  - Descriptions in filenames - when it's an action, leave off suffixes, e.g., "align" not "aligning."

  - Describe reel position by front, back, handle side, and badge / drag side (not left, -1, etc.)

  - If schematic is available, use part names from schematic, e.g., "eccentric"

Use numbers sparingly and consistently:

  - If a filename includes a number, it must indicate a *sequence*.

    Example: penn-720-remove-main-gear-1.jpg, penn-720-remove-main-gear-2.jpg = step progresses through a multi‑stage action or different angles of the same step.

  - For two or more slightly different *versions* of a shot, prefix with v1, v2, etc.

    Example: penn-720-hero-front-v1.jpg, penn-720-hero-front-v2.jpg = alternative candidates you’re evaluating; only one may end up in the guide.

  - Keep a simple photo-standards.md with sections like verbs, states, views, suffixes (-ref, -v1, -v2). Each time you invent a new term while renaming (lift, separate, inspect, hero-front, etc.), add it there and keep using the same spelling.

    - **Verbs**: align, clean, remove, grease, replace, lubricate, reassemble, test.

    - **States**: engaged / disengaged, pre-service, removed.

    - **Views**: front, handle-side, badge / drag-side, top, bottom, back, on-rod, left (angled left), right (angled right).

    - **Suffixes**: -ref (reference-only sets), -1, -2 (different views, generally higher numbers mean "more" - closer, larger angle, etc.) -v1/-v2 (versions, alt takes of same shot), numeric sequences for true progressions, `[processing]` like auto-contrast, etc., `[###]`px if resized.

    - **Usage**: hero- (used only when curating / copying / renaming files to project folder), -ref (used for files only used for internal reference, like unusable disassembly images).

    - **Features**: badge / logo, drag, cork-arbor, foot (often has writing on it), anti-rev (anti-reverse lever).

### Naming workflow

Import images from card to workspace `/[maker]/[model]/`

Several batch operations can be performed in XnView on the initial images.

Open folder in XnView, R-click an image, batch rename: `[slug]-[desc].jpg` for example, in the name box enter `pflueger-nobby-1963-#` and all the images will get the slug and a number. More detailed descriptors can be added to each file as the images are sorted.

## Batch convert

R-click, batch convert > Actions tab > Resize to 1800px / longest side, Auto contrast, Auto levels.

Output tab > Folder = various, e.g., images to be used in the repo overview would go to the project folder `/docs/img/[slug]/`

## Video workflow

### Cam settings

Software: [Guvcview](https://guvcview.sourceforge.net/) loaded on an Ubuntu laptop.

If Ubuntu needs updating it may cause issues with capturing video. To update Ubuntu: 

Ctrl + Alt + T
sudo add-apt-repository
ppa:pj-assis/ppa

Ubuntu refreshes, this should fix it. If not, reinstall Guvcview:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install guvcview

Cam: Logitech HD Pro webcam C920, 3.67mm, 20cm - 2m working distance.

On startup select cam. Use preset - this takes care of most settings. Select the aperture priority exposure, then switch back to manual.

  - Resolution: 1920x1080
  - Frame rate: 30 fps
  - Video codec: H.264
  - Container format: .mkv files

## Video export settings

Software is [Shotcut](https://www.shotcut.org) loaded on a Windows desktop. Export preset is YT1080p30 stack. This outputs an MP4 file with H.264 video and AAC audio, optimized for YouTube. Custom settings, based on h.264 main profile:

Video tab
  - Resolution: 1920x1080
  - Frame rate: 30 fps
  - Codec: libx264 (H.264)
  - Rate control: Averabe bitrate (ABR) or CBR
  - Bitrate: 8 mb/s (good quality, manageable file size)

Audio tab
  - Codec: AAC
  - Sample rate: 48000 Hz
  - Channels: Stereo
  - Bitrate: 128 kb/s

File sizes, approx., at 8Mb/s
  - 1.5 min clip ~ 90 Mb
  - 4 min clip ~ 256 Mb

For longer videos (~10 min) it might be good to try 6Mb/s to reduce file size.
