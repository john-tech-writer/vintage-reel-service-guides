# Vintage Reel Service Guides

This site documents service procedures for mid‑priced American‑made fishing reels from the 1930s–1970s.

This site is intended to provide a growing and evolving repository for service and repair guides plus historical background for mid-priced American-made reels for all types of fishing--spinning, spincasting, baitcasting, fly-fishing--from the 1930s through the 1970s; placing these reels in context of creating practical, usable, affordable balanced tackle for all types of fishing in combination with modern tackle.

Part of the purpose of this repository is to celebrate American craftsmanship of the early 20th century, and to provide resources for those interested in keeping concrete examples of that craftsmanship in working order, with the intent to use them in the field rather than simply collect, curate, and display them, although these activities are also valued.

Another aspect of this service/repair/usage approach is to suggest, explore, and discover how vintage reels can be integrated into modern tackle; for example, line will typically be new, and this repository will include information on appropriate pound-tests, line types, and spool capacities for each; this will facilitate making informed decisions about creating balanced tackle using a combination of the best of vintage and modern tackle.

## Spinning Reels

Text about spinning reels, an overview, some content, arrangement, and topics will be taken at least in rough form from the Perplexity space on reel service guides.

Major American manufacturers of the period will be listed and briefly reviewed in historical/functional context, including Pflueger, Penn, etc.

### Penn

Brief overview of Penn's spinning reels, the 700 series in particular, and references to their other types of reels. Places all the 700 series reels in context of creating balanced tackle for different fishing applications--species, salt/fresh, trolling, surf fishing, etc.

### The Guides

Each guide will provide step-by-step illustrated procedures for disassembling, servicing (cleaning and lubricating), and re-assembling the reel. The guides will also provide information on commonly required repairs [will this be documented within the service guide or linked to a separate procedure?]
