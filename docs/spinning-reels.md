# Spinning Reels

[Text about spinning reels, an overview, some content, arrangement, and topics will be taken at least in rough form from the Perplexity space on reel service guides.]

[Major American manufacturers of the period will be listed and briefly reviewed in historical/functional context, including Pflueger, Penn, etc.]

There are several distinct types of spinning reels:

**Open-faced:** There are several different typs of open faced spinning reels:

Full-bail: The most common design. One notable example is the Pfleuger Pelican 1020. This reel was also manufactured as a left-hand version, the 1020A. There seems to be some confusion in the marketplace about right-hand versus left-hand versions of spinning reels. Since spinning reels hang on the bottom of the rod rather than sitting on top, if the handle is on the left side of the reel--the most common configuration--it is correctly referred to as a right-hand model--this is the Pelican 1020. This is because handedness refers to which hand is used for casting, not retrieving--in spinning, the right-handed angler holds the rod in the right hand but retrieves with the left. So, the Pelican 1020A, the left-handed version will properly have the handle on the right side. However, since many of the parts for these reels are interchangeable, including the backplate where the model number is inscribed, it is not uncommon to see Pelicans with the handle on the left side (this is the model 1020), but with a cover plate that reads 1021--which is clearly wrong. To summarize:

More common, right-hand Pelican is the 1020. Handle is on the left.
Less common, left-hand Pelican (for left-handed anglers) is the 1020A. Handle is on the right.

The mid-century Pelican is a fixed-spool reel--the spool does not revolve. It has a full bail. It was Pfleuger's top-of-the-line spinning reel of that time, with a unique rear drag system.

Another American maker of this period that produced an entire range of open-faced spinning reels was Penn, with the Spincaster series, which included eight models which mostly differed in terms of heft.

Roller pick-up: The finger pick-up style was considered a bit of an oddball design and never became very popular. An iconic example of this type is the Pfleuger Pelican 1021, marketed as a reel for the more expert or advanced angler. Instead of a full wire bail the manual roller pick-up mechanism is engaged by hand.

Finger pick-up: Like the roller pick-up, the finger pick-up style was considered an odd design, probably even more so than the roller pick-up style. Classic mid-century American model is the Ocean City 350 Spin-A-Long, produced in the mid-1950s when spinning reels were relatively new to the U.S. market.

While this site does focus primarily on American-made reels, there were a few European makers that can sensibly be included in the overall picture of how reel designs were evolving in this time period. One of these was the Swiss maker Monti, who made the Super spinning reel, also a finger pick-up design. It also featured an adjustable drag nut.

**Closed-faced:** The closed-faced spinning reels are easily confused with reels more correctly referred to as "spin-casting" or "push-button" reels. All push-button reels are closed-faced, but not all closed-faced reels are push-button. True closed-faced spinning reels do not have a button for controlling the clutch and line release, like the classic Zebco 33 (still in production today, with a lot of internal changes). The Shakespeare 1810 series is a good pure example of a closed-face spinning reel. The Swedish-made Abu 506 is a bit more evolved version of the same design.

**Penn:** Brief overview of Penn's spinning reels and references to their other types of reels. [The Penn Spinfisher Series](/penn/penn-spinfisher-series.md) includes eight different models from ultralight to heavy duty.

**Pfleuger:** The Pelican.

**Ted Williams/Sears:** The 440. Like Craftsman tools of that era, very durable.
