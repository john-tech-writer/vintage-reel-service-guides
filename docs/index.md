# Vintage Reel Service Guides

This site's main purpose is to provide detailed, illustrated service procedures for mid‑priced American‑made fishing reels from the 1930s–1970s. It also provides repair procedures and background information on the various reels. This is a growing and evolving repository for service and repair guides and historical background for spinning, spincasting ("push-button"), baitcasting, and fly-fishing reels.

This repository honors American craftsmanship of the early 20th century and provides resources for those interested in restoring and keeping concrete examples of that craftsmanship in working order, with the intent to use them in the field rather than simply collect, curate, and display them, although these activities are also valued. Line capacities and other specifications are provided to place these reels in the context of creating practical, affordable, balanced tackle for all types of fishing, in combination with modern tackle.

While the main focus is on American reels, another important focus is on highlighting important manufacturers for each type of reel, and in some cases non-US examples are important to the overall story; for example, Swedish maker Abu's baitcasting reels--the 3000s, 4000s, and others of that series--were too influential to leave out.

## Background on Reel Types

Each of the major American reel manufacturers from this era produced a range of different types of reels. The background information is organized by reel type, then by manufacturer. For example, on the [spinning reels page](spinning-reels.md) you will find general background information on spinning reels and more specific information on manufacturers like Penn and Pfleuger, among others. The service guides that follow provide detailed illustrated procedures for servicing specific reels.

If your main interest is in servicing a specific reel you can easily just bypass all the overview information and go directly to the service guides.
